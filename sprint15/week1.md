<p>

sprint 15 kiezen van een framewerk 
je onderzoekt een nieuwe tech stack
en datgnee wat ik nu gebouwd hebt doe ik opniew in een andere tech stack
je neemt de mentorrol van jaar 1 serieus

</p>

volgende week presenteer je jouw onderzoek van de tech stack

lerend vermogen je gaat met een nieuw framework aan de slag dus dit kan je als bewijs indienen


de focus ligt nu op het individuele stuk en minder op samenwerken



html css js is clientside

de middleware is de cms en api en users

en je hebt serverside dus  node js 
database 
framework

factors for choosing a tech stack aricle to read

hierop letten tech stack
<ul>
  <li>
    platform
  </li>
  <li>
    
project type 
  </li>
  <li>
    
scalability
  </li>
  <li>
    
performancce
  </li>
  <li>
    
team experitze
  </li>
  <li>
    
maintiance
  </li>
  <li>cost</li>
  <li>hoeveel mensen werken eraan</li>
</ul>
cost 

allerlei zaken om rekening mee te houden

<h2>user experience and development principes</h2>

user experience and development principles
what is developer experience 

de ux en de dx en de cmx zijn zaken om reking mee te houden in het kiezen van de techstack
directus is een technische manier om na te denken hoe dit op je website eruit moet zien

jamstack site generators kies een tech stack

volgende week woensdag presenteer een tech stack

hier kan je alle techstacks kiezen en dan javascript kiezen :https://jamstack.org/generators/ 

dit leren https://www.11ty.dev/docs/ als techstack

https://docs.directus.io/blog/getting-started-directus-and-eleventy-11ty-3.html

ik ga mijn pagina namaken in eleventy js 



<h2>bespreekt framework</h2>

ik heb aan cyd advies gevraagd voor het framework en volgens haar is eleventy of astro te doen om te leren
ook heb ik gevraagd wat vreselijk is aan react en dat was omdat je veel javascript hebt met ook veel stappen 
en ik heb gevraagd of vue js te doen is en dat is ook vrij lastig 

Volgt aangeboden internationale ontwikkelingen in het vakgebied en maakt onder begeleiding keuzes over eigen ontwikkeling.


<p>ook heb ik gevraagd hoe ik images kleiner maak en de performance kan verbeteren op de pagina en dit gaf ze als advies
  
https://tinypng.com/ dit gebruiken voor oplossen van de images om het niet breder dan 16px te hebben

choices choices talk

directus
a headless cms configuration

it is a backend with a custamizable ui

it is design to help you quicker

you have the clients to have a administration 

it is  a backend with a ui

my role is

directus cloud the website and the platform 

directus tv 

my team looks for educations and understand what directus is 

how do we help them understand what it is 

we alos look after commuting by github

that group of people need support

the ultimate hope of communication is that they like it and tel other people

the 3rd is extension for the marketplace 

our community build those 

1 key extenion of being 

we open sourche but not full opensourche 
all of your use is free to use 
defence of gambling 
you can not discriminate them

we have support or advisery hours 

we have directus + where you have a starterkit

the team has 4 people

45 people mensen werken bij directus totaal

what hours do we keep with remote work
we seem to attract workaholics in theory 
i expectem there working hours and a lot of flexibility

the last 2 of 3 hours are full of meetings because then everyone is avaliable and workibg
because of the timezone

the more senior you get the more important you get


</p>

choices tradeoffs

the iron triangle 

you can never chose these 3 full 

and you don't realise you missing 1 

the focus is being good and cheap the delivery time for new features are slower
we are fewer available hours 

recently we had the privelege to look for good and fast and hire more peopel
there is a expatiotion to deliver quicker

Tradeoff of choices

perfectionism
chosing when to deliver 

more use cases 

we really need x or we lose the deal

as a experimental product you need to look how much people are going to use this product 
and is this time nessary or do we need to priorita


tech stack selection

knowledge for delivering

between good going quick or take a critiq look

there is difference between ui and ux

performance vs maintanablity

you can make something quicker 

by what degree can you make something 

how many users are going to use this

computation cost cost energy

there is a huge skill 

lovely readable code 

we puttiing the right white space define a variable or function

you have millions of data and very taxing database qeurys 


i could bash it out in tailwind 

no we not using tailwind and there is a learning curve

for the time to take and built this is gonne save time maintaine


velocity vs flexbility

velocity is how fast can you build something


innovation vs reliablity 

any business has r&d and this is a moneypit

you need a few money to r&d 

one of the biggest tradeofs is

how much money are you going to spend and
how much money do you get bacj


artificllenge intelligence

there are tradeoffs there is the cost of using ai

it cost money to perform

accuratacy is it right 

who assume the risk if you get it wrong and what are the consequence if you use it

the developer scence of problem solving 

that snippet is not true or old or fout

good and fast can be expsinive

fast en cheap can be low quality

cost benefit analysisis

other things not being done 

swot analsys 

weighted decission matrix



have i suffered from inposter syndroom
</p>


<p>
using cms

we can be used as content management

featues that we build have to benefit 80% of the users in teh core platform

live preview

it doesn't benefit 80% of the users

we were revenue we losing a lot of deals
 
you need a balance between good and quick


at worst we stop enqaging with them 

tech you use proably doesnt matter

what you can't meet 

maintanablity vs performance

its are your decisions to make

you are going to make shitty decisions before you can make the right

this is the learning curve that you need to do 

kevin louis  is his name 

bad decisions made is oke 

overtime you will make better decisisions

root decisions in user needs 

there are a set of distincte stakeholders 

we need to maintan the code 

thera are other steakholders like finance 

even are things are not optimal you can train this

ultimately there are your endless 

you care about your opt people 

what web framework do you use your end user do not care

for your endusers is useless

talking about velocity or what tools do we use

this is about our size and skills and do we meet them up and is it met

inside of my product team

the split is any trade of

the split is now the web team and the backend team

lines of code is a joke

in germany productivty is coming in ups and lows 

the way i manage my team we have quartely goals 

you deliver it or you don't deliver it

we are looking what is going wrong in that 3 months of planning

most of the work we do is at least 2 sprints

what other teams doing have implemencation 

in that 1 bigger team is there more abstraction
there is 1 leve more to manage

notion of player coach 
to be  a good manager take a lot of time
once you go over 3 or more people
